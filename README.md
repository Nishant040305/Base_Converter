# Base_Converter
This a python GUI based program which can convert any base system to any other base.
for example you want to convert 
10 in base 2 then it will be equal to 2^3 +0x2^2+2+0 i.e (1010)
same if you want to convert it into base 3 then 10 = 3^2+ 0*3+1=(101)
and so on

note you can convert it to base 36 after that the program started to use special symbol for particular number
and upto base 36 it will be limited to 0-9 and A-Z
